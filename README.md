### Features
1. Anonymous groups are created as bots, where messages are broadcasted to all members.
2. All identities are hidden, including name, username, avatar, online status, input status, etc.
3. User will be identified with a mask (emoji or multiple emojis).
4. Built-in management tools are included, such as banning, welcome message, pinned messages, etc.
5. Message ids, rather than message content, are stored by the bot only.

### Usage
Goto [@anonyabbot](https://t.me/anonyabbot), then follow the instructions in the bot. In brief:
1. Click `New Group` in [@anonyabbot](https://t.me/anonyabbot).
2. Create a new bot in [@botfather](https://t.me/botfather), and forward the token to [@anonyabbot](https://t.me/anonyabbot).
3. Your masquerade is set.

### Deploy by yourself
Create a `config.toml`:

```toml
[tele]
api_id = "12345678"
api_hash = "abcde1234567890abcde1234567890"

[father]
token = "12345678:AbCdEfG-123456789"
```

Your self-deployed version SHOULD clearly identify this repository on `/start`. Thanks.
